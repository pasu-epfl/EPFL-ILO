This repository is the product of a collaboration between EPFL and the International Labor Organization (ILO) to analyze Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and countries' commitments to a Just Transition. Special thanks to EPFL's students Jules Breton, Irem Sekeroglu, and Anna Dovha for their work handcoding the NDCs, following the [coding instructions](coding_instructions.pdf).

The resulting dataset is [here](ndcs_clean.xlsx). 

Figures, code, and data produced can be found in their respective folders.
